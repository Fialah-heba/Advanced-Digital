#**Advanced Digital Design**

##**Overview**

In this project you will build a simple part of a microprocessor. Firstly, you will build two main blocks:
the ALU and the register file, then you will connect them together and run a simple machine code
program on them.
In order to ensure that your design is related to yourself, various aspects of the design will be dictated by
your student ID number. These include the machine code used by your design, the contents of the register
file. This means that every student should have a unique design.
You have to work individually in this project and submit a report about your design and implementation
of this project.
